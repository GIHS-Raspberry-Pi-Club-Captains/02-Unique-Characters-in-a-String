## [Challenge] Unique Characters in a String

For this week's challenge: 

>Write a function that determines if any given [string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)) has all unique [characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing)) (i.e. no character in the string is duplicated). If the string has all unique characters, print "`all unique`". If the string does not have all unique characters, print "`duplicates found`."
